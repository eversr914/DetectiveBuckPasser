# DetectiveBuckPasser
Text Adventure Game
<p>
New York, The Bowery 1972
Detective Buck Passer is the assistant director of the homicide department for the NYPD's 9th precinct over in the filth infested Bowery district. Oddly enough that's right where he fits in. At one point in his life Buck might have had ambitions, goals, and taken a moral stand but too many years in the Bowery have eroded whatever of that he once had.

<p>
Detective Passer has two goals in his day to day life: don't do any paperwork and have enough change in his pocket lint to pickup a sixer of Shaefer from the bodega down the street on his way to his apartment by the train.

<p>
You play as Detective Buck Passer in his first text based adventure game. The developers would like to claim this design choice opens up a more imaginative world. The truth of why there is no animation probably falls closer to these inbreds never being able to color in the lines.
</p>
<p>
There has been a murder at an apartment block in the Bowery, it is up to Buck Passer to do what he does best: mess up the crime scene to push the body onto another task force so he doesn't have to do the paperwork.
