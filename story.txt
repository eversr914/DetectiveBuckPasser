bear is the super of a slum. His dad owns it and gave bear the job.
he starts in his apartment goes immediately to hg tries and buys coke, hgs trunk is locked, cant find his keys
you have to go around and go apartment to apartment doing favors for them to progress
after you get the keys go to hg, unlock the trunk. bears head is just sitting in a rubbermaid, hg picks up the head and the cokes under the head.
you then go back, sprinkle the blow on the body, it becomes the drug squads problem.
have an option to arrest hg for the murder of bear (how do we handle this?)

Bear is the murder victim, every apartment has a message from bear asking to hangout with something that he was supposed to do for them (fixing the toilet etc)
the rooms stay stagnent until an 'event' occurs -> you get an object or talk to a critical person, then the dialog changes/items change etc.


What kind of favours?
items?
why did hg kill bear?
what are the special items? keys, coke, favor items
