there are objects, characters, rooms, inventories, and items.
objects, characters, and rooms each have inventories that contain items
When an interaction is in progress a menu is pulled up -> character, inventory, room, object, and start menus, submenus exist

Inventories control all item transactions
-> Drop, give, combine, trade

Objects, Rooms, Characters, and Inventories change based on the game stage
As a room is loaded each of these looks in the database to see if they have a state for the next stage, otherwise they remain in the current state (this needs to happen only once per stage to maintain inventories)

Once a character has talked or completed something, have a randomly chosen statement from them as you talk to them

Talking is done by option number which are numbered. This is an array of numbered lines that have the possible options in a linked list format.
So if option 1 is selected then it has a list of the options after it -> say 3,4,7. These 3 options are displayed. Each of these also have the options that they can call until the transaction is over.
